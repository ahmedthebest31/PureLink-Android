# >_ PureLink Android 🛡️

**The Ultimate URL Sanitizer (Swiss Army Knife for Privacy).**

PureLink is a powerful, lightweight, and accessibility-first Android utility designed to strip tracking parameters from URLs, expand shortened links, and provide essential tools for developers. Wrapped in a high-contrast **Terminal/Hacker style** interface.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🛡️ Privacy & URL Sanitization
* **Deep Cleaning:** Instantly removes tracking tags like `utm_`, `fbclid`, `gclid`, `si`, and `ref` from shared links.
* **Smart Unshortener:** Safely expands shortened URLs (e.g., `bit.ly`, `is.gd`) in the background to reveal the true destination before you visit.
* **Bot-Proof Resolver:** Uses advanced User-Agent spoofing to bypass server-side bot protection when resolving links.

### 👁️ Background Monitor
* **Clipboard Guard:** Runs silently in the background to detect and clean copied links automatically.
* **Quick Settings Tile:** Toggle the monitoring service instantly from your notification shade (Quick Settings) without opening the app.
* **Haptic Feedback:** Vibrates to confirm when a link has been cleaned or processed.

### 📜 History & Smart Rules
* **Local History:** Added a secure, local history log (last 10 links) with instant "Copy" and "Open" actions.
* **Dynamic Rules Engine:** The app now silently fetches updated tracking filters from GitHub every week via `WorkManager`.

### ⚡ System Integration
* **Invisible Share Target:** Sharing a link to PureLink now triggers a transparent activity that cleans, copies, and closes instantly without disrupting your flow.
* **In-Place Text Cleaning:** Select any text or URL system-wide -> Click the context menu (3 dots) -> Choose "Pure Link". It will instantly clean and replace the link right where you are typing!

### 🎨 UI & Accessibility
* **3-Tab Bottom Navigation:** Switch seamlessly between Dashboard (stats & history), Tools (Base64, UUID, chat), and Settings.
* **Multi-Theme System:** Choose from Matrix (classic green-on-black), Light, Dark, or Dynamic (follows system wallpaper).
* **Smart Commands:** Paste or type a URL directly in the input box and clean it in one tap — no mode switching needed.
* **Ignore List:** Exclude specific domains from cleaning or URL processing.
* **YouTube Shorts Resolver:** Automatically converts `youtube.com/shorts/xxx` links to standard `watch?v=` format.
* **Adaptive Icons:** Modern Android 13+ adaptive launcher icons with proper foreground/background layers.
* **Full Localization:** Seamlessly switch between English and Arabic interfaces on the fly with full RTL support.
* **Jetpack Compose:** The entire UI is built with Jetpack Compose, resulting in a smoother, more responsive, and lighter interface.
* **Accessibility First:** Designed by a blind developer. Enhanced TalkBack support with labeled touch targets and semantic descriptions for all interactive elements.
* **Multi-Theme System:** Choose from Matrix (classic green-on-black), Light, Dark, or Dynamic (follows system wallpaper).
- **Cloud Boost** — Convert Dropbox share links to direct `?dl=1` download links and Google Drive `view` links to direct `uc?export=download` links
- **Clipboard Commands** — Type `!wa`, `!tg`, `!b64e`, `!b64d`, or `!uuid` followed by text, copy it, and PureLink processes it automatically (can be toggled off)

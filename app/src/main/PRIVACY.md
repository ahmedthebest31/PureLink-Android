# Privacy Policy for Pure Link

**Last updated: February 12, 2026**

Ahmed Samy developed the "Pure Link" app as an Open Source app. This SERVICE is provided by Ahmed Samy at no cost and is intended for use as is.

**Information Collection and Use**

Pure Link is designed with privacy as a priority. **We do not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information.**

The app operates primarily on your device. Any data processing (such as URL cleaning) is performed locally.

**Accessibility Services**

Pure Link uses the Android AccessibilityService API for a specific, user-initiated purpose:
1.  To detect when a URL is copied to the clipboard or clicked.
2.  To automatically remove tracking parameters and unshorten links before you open them.

**Important:**
* The Accessibility Service is **optional** and must be manually enabled by the user.
* The service does **not** collect or transmit any screen content or keystrokes to any external server.
* It is strictly used to parse URLs for safety and privacy protection.

**Clipboard Data**

The app may access your clipboard content solely to detect and sanitize URLs. This process happens locally on your device. No clipboard history is uploaded to any cloud server.

**Network Access**

The app uses internet access solely to:
1.  Resolve shortened URLs (e.g., bit.ly) to their final destination to protect you from malicious sites.
2.  Fetch updated tracking parameter rules from the official GitHub repository.

**Children’s Privacy**

These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.

Pure Link is the ultimate "Swiss Army Knife" for privacy-conscious users and developers. It is a powerful, lightweight utility designed to strip tracking parameters from URLs, expand shortened links, and provide essential system tools, all wrapped in a high-contrast Terminal/Hacker style interface.

🛡️ PRIVACY & URL SANITIZATION

• Deep Cleaning: Instantly removes tracking tags like "utm_", "fbclid", "gclid", and "ref" from shared links before you visit them.
• Smart Unshortener: Safely expands shortened URLs (e.g., bit.ly, is.gd) in the background to reveal the true destination.
• Bot-Proof Resolver: Uses advanced techniques to bypass server-side bot protections when resolving links.

👁️ BACKGROUND MONITOR

• Clipboard Guard: Runs silently to detect and clean copied links automatically.
• Quick Settings Tile: Toggle the monitoring service instantly from your notification shade.
• Haptic Feedback: Vibrates to confirm when a link has been processed.

♿ ACCESSIBILITY FIRST (Screen Reader Optimized)

• Designed by a blind developer specifically for maximum efficiency with Screen Readers (TalkBack).
• High-Contrast UI: Features a "Green on Black" terminal style, perfect for low-vision users and battery saving on AMOLED screens.
• Fully labeled interactive elements for a seamless navigation experience.

🛠️ DEVELOPER & SOCIAL TOOLS

• WhatsApp Direct: Chat with any number immediately without saving it to contacts.
• Telegram Direct: Open usernames directly.
• Dev Utilities: Built-in Base64 Encoder/Decoder and UUID Generator.

⚡ SYSTEM INTEGRATION

• Share Target: Share links directly from YouTube, Chrome, or Twitter to Pure Link for instant cleaning.
• Process Text: Select any text system-wide -> Choose "Pure Link Clean" from the context menu.

Pure Link is fully native, lightweight (~1MB), and respects your privacy with no unnecessary permissions.

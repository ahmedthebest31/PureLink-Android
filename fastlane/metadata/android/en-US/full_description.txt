Pure Link v2.0.0 is the ultimate "Swiss Army Knife" for privacy-conscious users. It is a powerful, lightweight utility designed to strip tracking parameters, expand shortened links, and maintain a history of your cleaned URLs, all wrapped in a high-contrast Terminal style interface.

🛡️ PRIVACY & URL SANITIZATION

• Deep Cleaning: Instantly removes tracking tags like "utm_", "fbclid", "gclid", and "ref" from shared links.
• Smart Unshortener: Safely expands shortened URLs (e.g., bit.ly) in the background to reveal the true destination.
• Bot-Proof Resolver: Bypasses server-side bot protections when resolving links.

📜 HISTORY & SMART RULES

• Recent History: Saves the last 10 processed links locally for quick access (Copy/Open).
• Auto-Updates: Automatically fetches the latest tracking filters from GitHub weekly, keeping you protected against new trackers without a full app update.

👁️ BACKGROUND MONITOR

• Clipboard Guard: Runs silently to detect and clean copied links automatically.
• Quick Settings Tile: Toggle the service instantly from your notification shade.
• Haptic Feedback: Vibrates to confirm when a link has been processed.

♿ ACCESSIBILITY FIRST (Screen Reader Optimized)

• Designed by a blind developer specifically for maximum efficiency with TalkBack.
• High-Contrast UI: "Green on Black" terminal style, perfect for low-vision users and battery saving.
• Fully labeled interactive elements for a seamless navigation experience.

⚡ SYSTEM INTEGRATION

• Share Target: Share links directly from YouTube or Chrome to Pure Link for instant cleaning.
• Process Text: Select any text system-wide -> Choose "Pure Link Clean".

Pure Link is fully native, lightweight (~2MB), and respects your privacy.
